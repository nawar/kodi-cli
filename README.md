kodi-cli
========

Kodi/XBMC bash script to send Kodi commands using JSON RPC. It also allows sending YouTube videos to Kodi.

## Usage

A sample usage would be 

`kodi-cli -[p|i|s|(y|q) youtube URL/ID|t "text to send"|o "youtube title"]`

Please check the [Arguments](#arguments) section on how to use the rest of the available options.

## Setup

You must either put your Kodi setup (found under "Interfaces") in the first few lines of the script itself, or put a file named `.kodirc` in your `$HOME` directory. This file (example provided) contains only four lines in *this specific order*:

```
The Kodi Host
The port Kodi listens on (the webserver port)
Username
Password
```

If you don't want to add your kodi passwword, you might leave the password line empty and instead specify a command invocation in the next line that returns your password on stdout.


```
The Kodi Host
The port Kodi listens on (the webserver port)
Username

Commannd invocation that returns the password on stdout (e.g. pass mykodibox/kodi)
```
